## War or Peace Project


### Questions and "final" notes (Sunday, 02.07.21)


  * This game mostly works. What doesn't work is when turn.winner is set to the string "No Winner." That throws an error tied to line 76 in game.rb.

  * A question I had after working on this project is - I use '@' for instance variables basically everywhere. Is this normal/does it follow Ruby conventions, or is there an alternative?

  * I wrote a method to generate cards by zipping 'rank' and 'value' arrays into a hash, but I did not get to text file loading in iteration 4.

  * What is good convention for _#notes_ within code?
  
  * What are best conventions/practices for _commit_ messages? Discussed in Mod 0 but have questions.
